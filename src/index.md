I blog about web development, focusing on the front end. I'm also a member of the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) core team.

You can check out some of my latest writing below. If you enjoy what you read, come say hi on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/geoffrich.net) or <a rel="me" href="https://front-end.social/@geoffrich">Mastodon</a>. I also have an [email newsletter](https://buttondown.email/geoffrich/) that I'll send out when I post something new, along with anything else I find interesting.

If you read one thing, read [Accessible Svelte transitions](/posts/accessible-svelte-transitions/).
