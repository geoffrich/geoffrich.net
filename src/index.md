I blog about web development, focusing on the front end. At the moment, I'm particularly interested in Svelte and web accessibility.

You can check out some of my latest writing below. I've also written for [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/author/geoffrich/). If you enjoy what you read, come say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/geoffrich_).
