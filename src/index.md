I blog about web development, focusing on the front end. At the moment, I'm particularly interested in [Svelte](/tags/svelte/) and [web accessibility](/tags/a11y/).

You can check out some of my latest writing below. I've also written for [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/author/geoffrich/). If you enjoy what you read, come say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/geoffrich_).

If you read one thing, read [Accessible Svelte transitions](/posts/accessible-svelte-transitions/).
