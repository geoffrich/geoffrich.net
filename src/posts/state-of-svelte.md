This Dot Labs hosted a "State of Svelte" livestream today with several folks from the Svelte team and community, including myself. If you’re curious about what’s happening with Svelte lately and where it’s going next, it's well worth a watch! Some of the topics include:

- how SvelteKit compares to the other server experiments in the ecosystem (Remix, Solid Start, React Server Components)
- the plan for Svelte 4 and a Svelte 5 wishlist
- testing your Svelte and SvelteKit apps
- switching the Svelte internals to JSDoc from TypeScript
- what makes the Svelte community special
