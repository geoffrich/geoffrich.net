Svelte 4 is here, and I guested on two shows talking about it!

Svelte 4 is mostly a behind-the-scenes update, and breaking changes should be minimal for most users. However, it does have some exciting improvements around custom element generation, IDE autocomplete, and hydration performance. See the [full announcement](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-4) and [migration guide](https://svelte.dev/docs/v4-migration-guide) for more.

First, PodRocket had me on for [an episode](https://podrocket.logrocket.com/svelte-4) where I discussed what's new in Svelte 4 as well as what's changed on the revamped [Svelte documentation site](https://svelte.dev). This was a great chat with an impressive turnaround - it was edited and posted 24 hours after recording!

Then last week This Dot Labs (who previously hosted a [State of Svelte](/posts/state-of-svelte/) event) had me and a couple other folks from the Svelte team (Ben McCann, Simon Holthausen, and Puru Vijay) on to discuss the release as part of a Svelte 4 Launch Party stream.
