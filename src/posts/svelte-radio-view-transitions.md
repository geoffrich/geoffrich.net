I returned to the [Svelte Radio](https://www.svelteradio.com/) podcast a couple weeks ago to talk all about View Transitions and Svelte! We talked about:

- how the browser can handle page transitions now
- using SvelteKit's `onNavigate` lifecycle hook to trigger a view transition
- how view transitions compare to Svelte's built-in transitions

You can [listen to the episode](https://www.svelteradio.com/episodes/view-transitions-in-sveltekit-and-beyond-with-geoff-rich) on all major podcasting platforms. Here are some relevant links from the conversation:

- Jake Archibald's [view transitions explainer](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/)
- the [onNavigate](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$app-navigation-onnavigate) lifecycle method
- [sveltekit-view-transition](https://github.com/paoloricciuti/sveltekit-view-transition), a library to make work with view transitions in SvelteKit easier
- my [Svelte Summit talk](https://youtu.be/K95TQ-Yh7Cw?si=mrorkfV6SWBuhMy7) on view transitions in Svelte
- [everything I've written](/tags/view%20transitions/) on view transitions
