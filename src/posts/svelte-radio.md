This week I had the pleasure of guesting on [Svelte Radio](https://www.svelteradio.com/), the best (and only?) Svelte-focused podcast on the web! We talked about what I do at Alaska Airlines, life so far as a Svelte core team member, and the recent Svelte Summit event. You can [listen to the episode](https://www.svelteradio.com/episodes/the-other-rich-geoff) on all major podcasting platforms.

Here are some relevant links from the conversation:

- Alaska Airlines' [Auro Design System](https://auro.alaskaair.com/), built using web components
- [Svelte Summit Spring 2022](https://youtu.be/qqj2cBockqE)
- My Svelte Summit talk from last year on [Svelte transitions and reduced motion](https://geoffrich.net/posts/svelte-summit-2021/)
- The [GitHub issue](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/5346) for improved reduced motion support in Svelte
- Video game music is great coding music. Lately I've been listening to the [Kirby and the Forgotten Land soundtrack](https://youtu.be/tLlperhRLQg)
